👋 About Me
I am a Data-driven Program Manager with a hybrid background spanning digital supply chain operations, high-volume retail logistics, and full-stack software development. I specialize in bridging the gap between engineering teams and non-technical stakeholders to deliver operational excellence.
This portfolio highlights my work as a Technical Product Owner where I architect, build, and deploy full-stack applications to solve human-centric problems.

Media Optimization: Implemented client-side video thumbnail generation using HTML5 Canvas to reduce bandwidth usage and improve UI load times.
Collision Handling: Developed a bounding-box system that dynamically recalculates node positions when new content is added to fit diverse screen sizes.
